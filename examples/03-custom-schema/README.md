# Custom Schema Example

This example demonstrates how to extend the library with your own field class. We create a `GyroTremor` field that has a `threshold` parameter and then use it in a form.

## How to run

```bash
npm install pd-form-core
npx ts-node index.ts
```

Open the printed descriptor to see the custom field definition in the `fields` map.
