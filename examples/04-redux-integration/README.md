# Redux Integration Example

This example illustrates how to use the descriptor with the builtâ€‘in viewer store. After building a minimal form we create a viewer store from the schema and dispatch an action to set a field value.

## How to run

```bash
npm install pd-form-core
npx ts-node index.ts
```

Observe the printed state to see the field value stored under its unique ID.
